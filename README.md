# MovieLens_Recommender

MovieLens is a research movie recommender system which was launched in 1997 and have been operating ever since to study the algorithms, interfaces, and user experience of recommender systems. 

The goal of recommender systems is to provide personalized product recommendations to users. These systems can suggest items to purchase, shows or movies to watch, articles to read, and much more. Well known organizations that rely on predictive user modeling for personalization approaches are Netflix and Amazon. Netflix systems recommend shows and movies for users to watch, while Amazon recommends similar items for a user to purchase.

The approaches to personalized recommender systems that were deployed in this project were k-nearest-neighbor using labels derived from k-means clustering analysis, item-based collaborative filtering, user-based collaborative filtering and matrix factorization with singular value decomposition.

The purpose of this project is to perform and evaluate modeling techniques with the intention of building a recommender system based upon the lowest error results.
